Holidaze is a web application that helps users find and book the perfect venue for their next vacation and arrangements.
You can browse, search, book, create, update and delete venues as you wish, depending on if you are a venue manager enlisting venues, or a user looking for their next venue.
This page is built using an API provided by Noroff School of Technology.
This web application is built as my final project exam at Noroff.
